## 📖 Sample Q&A

### Q. Difference between IAM User vs IAM Role?

**Answer (Natural):**  
An IAM User represents a person or application with long-term credentials.  
An IAM Role is like a **temporary hat** you wear — it provides **short-term access** with defined permissions, often assumed by services (like EC2) or for cross-account access.

👉 Example: A developer uses an **IAM User**, but an **EC2 instance assumes an IAM Role** to read/write from S3.
